================================================================================
2. HARVEST DATE (PHENOLOGY VALIDATION)
================================================================================

Source: TUDU1501.WHA + ERNTE.csv
Variable: HDAT (Harvest Date)
Value: 15237 (DOY 237 = August 25, 2015)

Days after planting: 237 - 77 = 160 days
Interpretation: This is the observed harvest date, which can be used as proxy
for physiological maturity (typically harvest occurs 5-10 days after maturity)

Simulated maturity: DOY 221 (144 days after planting)
Observed harvest: DOY 237 (160 days after planting)
Gap: 16 days (simulation matures early)

Note: Actual physiological maturity date not recorded in dataset


================================================================================
3. THOUSAND KERNEL WEIGHT (YIELD COMPONENT)
================================================================================

Source: lte_duernast.V1_0_PFLANZENLABORWERTE.csv
Variable: TKG (Tausendkorngewicht)
Units: grams per 1000 kernels
Observations: 64 (one per plot)

Sample of observed TKG values:
  Treatment 1: 37.85, 43.59, 40.85, 42.06 g
  Treatment 2: 43.07, 41.95, 42.02, 44.79 g
  Treatment 3: 37.89, 43.46, 42.37, 42.37 g
  (Continue for all treatments...)

Range across all treatments: 37.85 - 44.79 g
Mean: ~42 g (typical for spring wheat)

COMPARISON WITH SIMULATION:
Simulated kernel weight is determined by G2 parameter (39 mg for Hartog_KY)
Observed mean: 42 g = 42,000 mg
Simulated G2: 39 mg
This is for individual kernel, not TKG which includes additional factors

Note: TKG can be used for yield component validation if model outputs
individual kernel numbers and weights


================================================================================
4. PLANT BIOMASS (DRY MATTER)
================================================================================

Source: lte_duernast.V1_0_PFLANZENLABORWERTE.csv + ERTRAG.csv
Variable: Hp_Trockenmasse (dry matter)
Units: Originally in g/m², converted to kg/ha in ICASA processing

Sample observed dry matter values:
  Various sampling dates throughout season
  Final harvest dry matter used for yield calculations

Range: 36.02 - 77.27 g/m² (from laboratory measurements)

Note: Full biomass data would require detailed time series which may not
be available for all plots and dates. Harvest biomass can be estimated
from grain yield and harvest index.


================================================================================
5. FERTILIZER APPLICATION DATA (MANAGEMENT VALIDATION)
================================================================================

Source: lte_duernast.V1_0_DUENGUNG.csv
Variables: Termin (date), N (nitrogen amount), Duengemittel_ID (fertilizer type)
Observations: 192 records for 2015 (64 plots × 3 applications)

COMPLETE ACTUAL FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS:

This data is used as INPUT to the simulation, not for validation.
However, it confirms:
- Exact nitrogen amounts applied (0 to 180 kg/ha total)
- Exact application dates (April 8, June 1, July 2)
- Fertilizer types used (6 different materials)

No independent fertilizer uptake measurements to validate against model
estimates of fertilizer recovery or efficiency.


================================================================================
6. SOIL DATA (INITIAL CONDITIONS)
================================================================================

Source: SoilGrids data + field measurements
Variables: Soil texture, hydraulic properties, chemical properties

Available:

- Bulk density
- Organic carbon content
- pH
- Hydraulic properties (field capacity, wilting point)

NOT Available in raw data:
- Initial soil moisture at planting (estimated from weather)
- Initial soil nitrogen levels (estimated conservatively)
- Detailed soil profile chemistry

Note: Soil data used for model initialization, not typically used for
validation (soil properties are inputs, not outputs)


================================================================================
7. WEATHER DATA (ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS)
================================================================================

Source: lte_duernast weather station data → TUDU1501.WTH
Variables: TMAX, TMIN, RAIN (daily)

- Precipitation: 0 to 44.1 mm/day
- Total growing season rainfall: 327 mm

Solar radiation: ALL values were -99 (missing) in original data
Solution: Estimated for all 365 days using Hargreaves equation

Note: Weather data is INPUT to simulation, provides environmental forcing

10. VALIDATION STRATEGY USED
================================================================================

Given available observed data, validation focused on:

PRIMARY: Grain yield comparison (simulated vs observed HWAM)
- 15 treatment means compared
- Statistical metrics: R², RMSE, MBE, MAE, d-index
- Treatment-by-treatment error analysis
- Nitrogen response curve validation

SECONDARY: Phenology timing (simulated maturity vs observed harvest)
- Maturity gap quantified (16 days early)
- Growing season length compared (144 vs 160 days)
- Fertilizer timing implications assessed

DERIVED: Nitrogen use efficiency
- Fertilizer use efficiency (FUE) = yield response / N applied
- Simulated: 37.5 kg/kg
- Observed (calculated): 33.5 kg/kg
- Both within 20-40 kg/kg benchmark

NOT VALIDATED (data not available):
- Emergence timing
- Anthesis timing  
- Biomass accumulation over time
- Leaf area development
- Soil moisture dynamics
- Soil nitrogen dynamics
- Water use efficiency
- Grain nitrogen concentration

13. CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

WHAT WE CAN VALIDATE:

✅ Grain Yield - PRIMARY validation metric
   64 observations across 15 treatments
   High quality, multiple replications
   Suitable for comprehensive statistical validation

✅ Harvest Date - SECONDARY validation metric  
   Single observation for all treatments
   Proxy for maturity timing
   Useful for phenology assessment

✅ Yield Components - TERTIARY validation metric
   TKG data available (64 observations)
   Could be used for detailed yield component analysis
   Currently not fully utilized

VALIDATION LIMITATIONS:

⚠️ No time-series data (only endpoint measurements)
⚠️ No intermediate phenology observations
⚠️ No nitrogen uptake measurements
⚠️ No soil monitoring data during season
⚠️ Limited biomass partitioning data

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:

The available observed data (primarily grain yield with 64 observations)
is SUFFICIENT for:
- Validating nitrogen fertilizer response ✅
- Assessing treatment differentiation ✅
- Calculating fertilizer use efficiency ✅
- Evaluating model performance ✅

But INSUFFICIENT for:
- Detailed process-level validation ❌
- Phenology calibration beyond endpoint ❌
- Nitrogen dynamics validation ❌
- Water balance validation ❌

For this dataset, validation appropriately focuses on grain yield and
nitrogen response, which are well-measured and represent the primary
research questions of the fertilization experiment.


================================================================================
